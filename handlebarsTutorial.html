  <li> Templates
  <br>

Once you have the library in place, you can start writing templates. The recommended way of adding templates to your page is by including them in <script> tags with a special type. The type attribute is important, otherwise the browser will attempt to parse them as JavaScript (which they are not).

The templates have an easy to grasp syntax. They can contain HTML and text, mixed with Handlebars expressions. Expressions are wrapped in double or triple curly braces {{}}. Expressions tell Handlebars to include the value of variables or to execute helper functions. Templates need to be compiled to a JavaScript function before use. You can see an example below. Note that we are using jQuery to make working with the DOM easier, but Handlebars can work perfectly without it.</li>
